            <p>
                I founded Haven Trauma Therapy and Consulting because I am passionate about offering resources that provide relief for people who have experienced trauma.

            <p>
                I am a clinical social worker, licensed in the state of New York, with more than a decade of experience in trauma work. I have worked with hundreds of
                individuals across diverse communities. I consider providing appropriate care for trauma survivors as they courageously tend to the impact of their 
                most painful experiences as one of my greatest responsibilities and privileges. The lessons I have learned from others’ willingness to be vulnerable 
                with me are as influential to my approach as my formal education.
            </p>

                After earning an MSW from Columbia University, I obtained a certificate in Integrated Trauma Studies by completing a two-year program at the Institute 
                for Contemporary Psychotherapy. I am certified in Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) which is one therapeutic intervention designed to 
                alleviate the distress associated with traumatic memories.
            </p>

                In addition to providing services to individuals, I have designed, developed, and managed community-based therapeutic and social-emotional programs. Also, 
                as a director-level consultant, I led project teams working with client organizations seeking to improve their community’s ability to understand, prevent, 
                or respond to sexual harassment and abuse.
